Welcome to my academic homepage.

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Laboratory (CVPRL)](https://www.lut.fi/en/research-groups/computer-vision-and-pattern-recognition-laboratory-cvprl), LUT University, Finland.
I am supervised by Prof. [Heikki Kälviäinen](https://www.lut.fi/en/profiles/heikki-kalviainen) and collaborate closely with Prof. [Xin Liu](https://sites.google.com/view/xinliu/).

I received my M.Sc. and B.Eng. degrees from Tianjin University, China, in 2024 and 2021, respectively.

My research focuses on affective computing, multimodal large language models, and trustworthy Emotion AI.
